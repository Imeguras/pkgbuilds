# Custom PKGBUILD's for Arch Linux
So here are some handmade PKGBUILD for various things I use on Arch Linux. At the moment im writing this im not an official maintainer or packager and thats why you'll find random packages here. It also might serve as a platform for me to gather some experience in packaging and to learn more about the Arch Linux packaging system and later maybe become an official packager(at least for the AUR).

## Lawless
Im not one to really read the full license and im trying to be careful of which packages i put here. But if i miss some distribution clause and you wish to take it down please contact me and i'll remove it.

## List
- JLink Software(only the executables)(the official one is ultra old and for some reason doesnt have everything)
